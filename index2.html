<p>My right wrist is a canvas, 
<br>Staining the crevice between two veins, 
<br>is an abstract-expressionist splatter of red.
<br>A monochromatic Pollock?
<br>or
<br>An abstract Matisse?
<br>The red splatters spray my knuckles; 
<br>A few minimalistic dots . . .
<br>Less is more
<br>More is painful 

<br>Iâ€™m wearing purple pants today, 
<br>My purple bruise is a lovely accessory 
<br>A tattoo of tiny pixels
<br>decorates my right forearm 
<br>everyday, the resolution decreases,
<br>the dots will eventually disappear
<br>leaving me with lilac remnants
<br>until I am no longer coordinated

<br>Like, strawberry jam on wheat bread
<br>blobs of chunky red adorn my knees
<br>jam, spread unevenly, 
<br>bread, a little burnt
<br>sandwiched by my regrettable jeans, 
<br>ouch, walking really hurts
