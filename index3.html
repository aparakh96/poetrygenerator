<p>This is a scream.</p> 
<p><br>It wraps around your throat,    </p>
<p><br>contracts your lungs and    </p>
<p><br>binds your legs together.     </p>
<p><br>Oddly enough it is a bandage dress,    </p>
<p><br>and people say it is quite slimming on you.
    </p>
    
<p>There is a sweater, knitted of 3 am's.</p>
<p><br>Some of the stripes are late nights, working.</p>
<p><br>Some are ticking clocks staring at your ceiling.</p>
<p>
  <br>Some are sleepy bliss, the walk home with your best friend. </p>
  <p><br>(It is suggested that you wear this to bed)
    </p>

<p>This is a wrap made of both water and ocean waves,</p>
<p><br>it ebbs and flows as it to rock you to sleep. 
    </p>
